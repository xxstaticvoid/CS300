What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
Throughout this course's projects, I had to determine which data structures were best sutied for certain situations, including things like data storage and data manipulation. It was also very important to consider factors like time complexity and space complexity of certain operations and the algorithims that allow the data structure to be interacted with. This made structures that faster and lighter much more appealing than one that would be slow. From the devleloper's perspective though the slower ones are typically the easiest to make and quciker to produce.  


How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
Data Structures are vital for orginizing data and allowing data to be easier to manipulate. It seems from this class that they are essential for writing optimized code and useful for solving complex problems (especially when the right structure is chose for the job). Data Structures like hash tables and binary search trees allow for faster searching and insertion of data than simpler structres like an array. 


How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
My main roadblock for many of the assignments was just plain motivation. I work 4 twelve hour shifts each week as a automation technician, so I found it really hard to find time to complete assignments on time. I work the night shift, so I would often do small stuff like zyBooks activites and discussion posts while at work, and save the big stuff like projects for my weekends. Professor Lippincott was very understanding and didn't mind if my assignments were slightly late, so big thanks to him. There was a few times I had to ask chatGPT for some advice on how to handle a coding problem like most recently for project two, I struggled coming up with an idea for hashing the course id strings into keys in the hash table. So I worked along with it to come up with a solution.  


How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
After working on and finishing Project Two i think that my overall approach to software design has been expanded. Going forward I will think more critcally about the data structures and alogrithms I use. I will now approach new problems with a stronger emphasis on planning and evaluating trade-offs before writing code and consider factors like time complexity when determing soultions for new problems. 


How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Honestly I don't think this class helped me too much in this regard. I think going forward i will break my code into smaller, reusable functions and to use clear naming conventions so the logic is easier to follow. I definetly think that for many of the assignments I could've doen a better job with documentation - like naming varaibles and making helpful comments.
